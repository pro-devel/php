        Hey, my name is Saber Hosney but you have figured that already, haven't you ? anyway
        I'm a full stack developer, I usually write code for fun sake and sometimes for learning purposes.
        I have interest in PI Constant and AI and how it works. For some reason that I don't know I got interested in
        Poincare Conjecture.
        I usually get interested in anything and start to learn it, I even learned medicine, cyber security, psychology;
        weird right? we live to learn.<br>
        I'm currently enrolled in ComputerScience degree, something that may be worth to mention : I passed the 10k
        rule!
        one last thing, Internet rule 101: if something exist, there's a web version of it.
    </p>
