It's a simple way to use riotgames API with guzzle and laravel to display the data in this commit I just refrenced to oen sample . 


how to run it ?

install laravel , create a new project then copy and paste those folders to your newly created project that's it.


You will find Riot API within Curl controller and Curl view . on the /curl :)
